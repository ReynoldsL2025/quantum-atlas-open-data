# Quantum Analysis of ATLAS Open Data ⚛️🧠

This repository demonstrates a **hybrid quantum–classical workflow** applied to
**real ATLAS Open Data** using Google Colab and Qiskit.

The project connects:
- High-energy physics (ATLAS jets)
- Classical preprocessing (Python, Awkward Arrays)
- Quantum feature encoding and measurement

## 📌 Project Goals
- Load and inspect ATLAS PHYSLITE data (streaming, no downloads)
- Extract physically meaningful features (jet kinematics)
- Encode collider events into quantum states
- Compute quantum observables as event-level features

## 🧰 Tools Used
- ATLAS Open Magic
- Uproot & Awkward Arrays
- Qiskit
- Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run cells top-to-bottom
3. No local installation required
